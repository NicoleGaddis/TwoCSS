<h2>Differences &lpar;On Average&rpar;</h2> 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Cost</th> <td>Knitting uses less yarn, thus tends to be less costly</td>
        <td>Crochet uses more yarn, thus costs more per project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Time</th> <td>Knit projects take more time due to the smaller height of the stitches </td>
        <td>Crochet stitches are usually taller and as such projects are faster to make</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Apperance</th> <td>Knit tends to be thinner and more flexible, works best for clothes</td>
        <td>Crochet is thinker and less flexible, works better for things that need to be durable and for making objects</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Learning</th> <td>Knitting can be harder to start learning: 
            <ul>
                <li>Knitting stiches are secured by the stitch in the next row, thus all of the stiches are unsecured with the potential to be dropped</li>
                <li>To go back and fix knitting mistakes you have to stitch "backwards" so that you dont undo more than needed and have to start completely over when you only need to fix one row</li>
                <li>There are less stitches avaible when knitting, and they aren't as complex which means knitting can be automated and done by a machine</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>Crochet can be easier to start learning:
            <ul>
                <li>A Crochet stitch is secured by the stitch next to it thus there is only one unsecured stitch at a time, while the stich can still be dropped it is easier to fix</li>
                <li>Crochet can be unraveled by pulling the yarn and is easy to control as it will only affect one stitch at a time, you will only need to start over completely if there was a major error &lpar;or if you lose count when working in the round, which is used when making closed objects like a sphere or a cylindrical shape&rpar;</li>
                <li>There is a larger selection stitches available that vary in complexity to be used in crochet, which can be daunting, some of which can actually look like knitting. Crochet has to be done by hand and can not be done by a machine</li>

        <h4>Crochet:</h4>
        <p>
            The origin of the technique of crochet is largly unknown. There are theories that suggest that it could have started in Arabia then spread via the trade routes, or it may originate from the indigenous tribes of South America, or it could have evolved from a needlework technique from China that spread to surrounding areas.
